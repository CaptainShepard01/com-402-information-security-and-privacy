In this part you should implement one such dictionary attack.

You should notice that once you have a dictionary you can compute the hashes of all those words in it, and create a lookup table. This way, each next password you want to crack is nothing more than a query in the lookup table. To tackle this problem, passwords are usually ‘salted’ before hashing. Salt is exactly two characters long and it contains only hexadecimal characters. In this part of the exercise you should implement another attack using a dictionary. We generate a password by simply selecting a random word from a dictionary ([rockyou.txt](https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt)) and appending a random salt to it. The password is then hashed with SHA-256 and hexdigest and salt are available to you. Your task is to crack the passwords.\n",
